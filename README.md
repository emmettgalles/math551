# MATH 551 (Elementary Topology)

This repository is designed to house information related to the MATH 551 course at UW-Madison. This is an active repository, so changes will be made to the files on a somewhat frequent basis. I will post information about the files below, so please reference this markdown first if an issue or concern arises.

I welcome feedback, questions, or comments you may have about any file in this repository or about the repository as a whole. Please feel free to reach out at egalles@wisc.edu.
